### Durianpay.id Lead Software engineer *(August 2024 - Now)*
Due to my performance during my time in the payment team and my ability to communicate with both my Product Manager and external parties, I was promoted to Lead Software Engineer, leading a team of 4 people. In this part of my career, my squad is handling settlements, this is performance intensive part of our whole financial operation, requiring millions of rows to be read and written in under an hour to ease work on the operations team. We are responsible in identifying slow queries, operations, and automation in settlements. 
* Design and implement new settlement processing flow
    - Spearheaded the design and implementation of a new settlement flow, resulting in a 100% increase in processing speed and a 50% reduction in database load.
    - Identified key inefficiencies in the previous settlement flow, including bottlenecks and high database load, through in-depth analysis of system performance and transaction data.
    - Reduced infrastructure costs by optimizing resource usage, contributing to long-term operational efficiency.
* Design Automated Settlement Scheduler
    - Led the design and implementation of an automated settlement scheduler, streamlining the process and ensuring accurate, timely settlements without manual intervention.
    - Integrated the scheduler with existing systems, automating settlement cycles based on predefined business rules and conditions.
    - Improved operational efficiency by eliminating manual errors, reducing human intervention, and freeing up valuable team resources for higher-priority tasks.
    - Enhanced system reliability and accuracy, reducing settlement processing time and minimizing the risk of delays or errors.
    - Delivered a solution that significantly improved overall workflow management, contributing to more predictable and seamless financial operations.
* Designed Settlement Reconciliation System Using Outlook IMAP Server
    - Led the design and development of a settlement reconciliation system that integrates with the Outlook IMAP server to automate the process of matching and reconciling settlement data from email-based reports.
    - Developed custom scripts and tools to securely retrieve and parse settlement-related emails, streamlining the reconciliation process and improving accuracy.
    - Enhanced data accuracy and efficiency by automating the extraction of relevant financial data from email attachments and integrating it with internal databases for faster reconciliation.
    - Reduced manual intervention, eliminating common errors and discrepancies associated with manual data entry and reconciliation.

Promoted from Associate Software Engineer to Software Engineer within 6 months due to significant contributions in payment systems development, including implementing standardized APIs and integrating third-party payment solutions.
* Internal Approval & Processing System: Designed and implemented a highly extendable internal approval and processing system, reducing human error by requiring multiple approvals for each action. Initially built for 2 actions, the system now supports over 15 actions, with no need for fixes to the main flow. The design is intuitive, scalable, and easy to maintain.
* Indonesia's Standardized Payment API (SNAP): Led the integration of the new national SNAP payment API into our platform. Acted as the primary liaison with the National Bank teams to ensure seamless implementation and compliance with local payment standards.
* Direct Bank Integration for Payments: Spearheaded the end-to-end flow for accepting debit and credit card payments.
