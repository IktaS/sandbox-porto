## Experience
### Durianpay.id Lead Software engineer *(August 2024 - Now)*
Due to my performance during my time in the payment team and my ability to communicate with both my Product Manager and external parties, I was promoted to Lead Software Engineer, leading a team of 4 people. In this part of my career, my squad is handling settlements, this is performance intensive part of our whole financial operation, requiring millions of rows to be read and written in under an hour to ease work on the operations team. We are responsible in identifying slow queries, operations, and automation in settlements. 
*  Implementing automated processing queue
### Durianpay.id Software Engineer *(August 2023 - July 2024)*
Due to my contribution, in 6 months I got promoted from Associate Software Engineer to Software Engineer. I am moved from the team that has been handling Disbursement to the team that is handling Payment. In this part of my career, I learned how interact and experiment with third party API regarding payments, not only implementing Indonesia’s standardized payment API (SNAP) but also connecting with CIMB Bank Credit Card payment API in accepting credit card payment for our system. Some notable projects:
* Designed and implemented an internal approval and processing system. This reduces the possibility of operation human error as now multiple people are needed to ensure an action is executed. This system was designed to be highly extendable, and even until now, from the initial 2 action it was designed for, now has been extended to more than 15 actions, with none requiring any fixes to the main flow. The design is intuitive to extend and easy to understand
* Indonesia has been making a new standardized payment API (SNAP), due to this we are supposed to implement this API. As the one who can communicate with the National Bank teams, I am in charge of implementing this SNAP API to integrate with our provider.
* As part of our ongoing efforts to directly connect with banks, one of our targets is to connect directly to banks to accept debit and credit card payments. I am in charge of creating the end-to-end flow for accepting card payments, integrating the API to communicate with CIMB Bank regarding the payments, and also implementing the settlement from the payments.
### Durianpay.id Associate Software Engineer *(January 2023 - July 2023)*
As part of Durianpay’s small team of engineers, I am tasked with a lot of responsibility over the overall tech stack. Making improvements that contributed to the whole team. Some of my achievements during my time as associate includes:
* As one of the more experience with Go in the company, I was able to give my insight on how to better use the language. From context propagation to ensure graceful shutdowns of our system, to using Go’s very powerful testing package to write unit test properly.
*  Together with the team, implemented a dynamic disbursement system that is able to pick the best disbursement rails based on pricing and stability of the provider. This key feature ensures that Durianpay will be able to maximize profits for each and every disbursement transaction. For exact numbers, we are given the pricing of Rp 1500 for each transaction using our Provider, but with direct bank rails, in some banks we can get Rp 100 per transaction, that’s a 93% in cost reduction per transaction.
### Tokopedia.com Backend Software Engineer *(August 2022 - November 2022)*
Still as part of Digital Bills and Top-Up Core Team, I am tasked with more responsibility. I lead the development of a new feature in the core team for users to be able to refund their order in case Tokopedia’s Third Party Provider has issues fulfilling their bills, thus reducing the need for Tokopedia Customer Service to handle every refund request. This feature is used 2500 times a week, reducing the workload of CS team by 70%.
### Tokopedia.com Software Engineering Intern *(February 2022 - August 2022)*
As part of Digital Bills and Top-Up Core Team, I am responsible for creating and maintaining the core features of Tokopedia’s vast Digital Goods Ecosystem which serves up to 2 million request daily. During my time, I am responsible for migrating legacy code REST API to gRPC, which requires me to be able to learn and understand legacy code quickly, while writing code that refactors old code and make them comply with the current standards. Aside from migration, I am also responsible for other features that requires me to work with many other teams across Tokopedia.
### Bukalapak.com Software Engineering Intern *(June 2021 - September 2021)*
I lead the development of internal search debugging tool. Including development of the main algorithm, designing and discussing the architecture of the system with Bukalapak’s core architecture team. I created the main algorithm to allow for dynamic search queries and designed the code architecture to allow extensibility for the created system
